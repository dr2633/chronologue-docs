# Runtime Labs  

_The operating system for time-aware agents_

We build infrastructure that helps intelligent agents and humans coordinate, reflect, and act across time. From programmable calendars to persistent memory vaults and structured runtimes — our systems turn time into a first-class primitive.

## Products

### Chronologue  

**Temporal runtime for coordination** 

Transform your calendar into a programmable execution surface. Plan, schedule, and reflect with memory-aware agents.

### MemPort  

**Long-term memory vault**  

Log and manage personal memory traces. Enable persistent storage, auditability, and structured self-reflection.  

---

### Agent Runtime  

**Execution layer for structured agents** 

Manage plans, queues, execution, and profiling — inspired by CUDA’s host-device model. Built for developers and agentic systems.

---

### Tempo Tokens  

**Time modeling and personalization layer**  

Encode duration of events into your scheduling systems. Build adaptive agents with efficient time-awareness.

---

## Our Vision

We believe agents should reason in time. Runtime Labs builds the primitives that make this possible:

- **Memory** for reflection and recall  
- **Execution** for intelligent scheduling  
- **Coordination** for multi-agent workflows  
- **Timing** for accurate duration estimation and planning in context.
