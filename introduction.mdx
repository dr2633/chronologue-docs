As agents grow more capable, they face a fundamental bottleneck: time. Most economically useful actions -- logistics, scheduling, service coordination -- depend not only on intelligence in retrieval, but on intelligence grounded in precise, real-world scheduled activities. 

Even as models scale, agents must stay grounded in time and context. This canâ€™t be solved by scaling pretraining, and requires protocols and interfaces for structured memory and real-time planning. 

**Chronologue** is a programmable and editable timeline and interface for agents and users -- designed to support memory, planning, and action over time. Built on the MCP, it provides structured coordination between agents and humans through a shared, familiar interface: the calendar. 

By linking events, reflections, and goals in a coherent and accessible timeline, Cursor Calendar enables agents and users to reason more effectively beyond single prompts and isolated sessions or projects -- to take meaningful actions on our behalf in and across time.
