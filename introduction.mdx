## Chronologue Documentation

**Chronologue** is a platform for orchestrating structured memory into scheduled actions—integrated with calendar APIs to support coordination and planning.

Built for both user workflows and AI-driven agent scheduling, it transforms structured conversational histories, goals, observations, and planned actions into validated `.ics` events—ready for synchronization with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other platforms.

**For Users:** Chronologue provides a transparent interface for reviewing past interactions, scheduling future events, and coordinating actions over time—designed for reliability and clarity in daily workflows.

**For Developers:** Its local-first design and schema-driven architecture ensure memory traces can be validated, edited, and synchronized consistently across calendar systems.

## Core Components

- **Memory Trace Ingestion**  
    Structured memory traces (JSON) capturing tasks, reflections, goals, or events are ingested through a standardized API format.
    
- **Validation Layer**  
    All traces are validated against a strict schema to ensure consistency, completeness, and compatibility with calendar event standards ([RFC 5545](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545)).
    
- **ICS Generation Engine**  
    Memory traces are transformed into `.ics` events with properly formatted timestamps, UID generation, summaries, descriptions, and optional metadata fields (location, attendees).
    
- **Editing and Previewing**  
    Generated events can be edited in place, with Markdown previews for human-friendly review before synchronization.    

- **Calendar Synchronization Modules**  
    Built-in modules allow direct syncing with:
    
    - Google Calendar API (OAuth2 authorized)
        
    - Apple Calendar (local `.ics` import or native API integration)
        
- **Agent Compatibility**  

    Chronologue provides a foundation for conversational agents and memory-grounded planners to operate over real-world time constraints, enabling "memory-to-action" pipelines in autonomous systems.
    
### Key Features

- JSON-based memory trace ingestion and validation  
- Automatic `.ics` file generation from structured traces  
- UID preservation and robust timestamp management  
- Editable event pipelines with Markdown preview output  
- Integration pathways for conversation agents and planning systems  

### What You Can Do with Chronologue

- Convert natural language prompts into `.ics` calendar events
- Ground model behavior in memory and temporal constraints
- Build editable timelines of reflections, goals, and actions
- Integrate with Google Calendar or Apple Calendar via `.ics` sync
- Extend to multi-agent coordination using tempo tokens and MCP

## Why Now?

Scaling model parameters is not enough. To reason and act effectively, agents must:

- Remember past commitments
- Understand temporal constraints
- Adapt actions over evolving timelines

Chronologue addresses this gap by giving both users and agents a **shared calendar interface** for memory traces, event coordination, and long-term plans.

## Calendar as Cognitive Interface for Scheduling Agents 

Calendars are not just for meetings — they scaffold and externalize memory -- providing a tool for planning and coordinating action across individuals and groups.

Most people already use calendars to manage daily tasks, structure long-term goals, and collaborate with others. They offer a familiar and accessible interface for externalizing intent over time.

Crucially, calendars are well-suited for integration with intelligent systems:

- **APIs are widely available** (e.g., Google Calendar, iCal)
- **Scheduling aligns naturally with language** — e.g., “remind me,” “block off time,” “move to next week”, "summarize events from last Tuesday", etc. 
- **Voice and chat-based prompts** map cleanly onto calendar operations

Despite this, calendars remain underutilized as interfaces for organizing prior conversation history, planning future events, and **coordination tools for managing and grounding agents in user context. Most systems still treat scheduling as an endpoint—not as a structured context for shared reasoning and planning.
