**Chronologue** is a memory-grounded planning system that integrates language models with calendar data to support personalized scheduling, reflection, and schedule-aware response and suggestions. Agents reason over structured event timelines and assist users through a familiar calendar interface. In turn, users can schedule and steer agent behavior by prompting their calendar to organize scheduled activities.
