## Chronologue Documentation

Chronologue is a platform for turning structured memory (e.g., conversation history) into scheduled events using calendar APIs—enabling retrieval, coordination, and planning.

It supports a bidirectional link between calendars and language models: events are generated from memory traces, and calendars in turn provide context for agent reasoning and decision-making.

## Language Models and Calendars: A Bidirectional Loop

Chronologue is designed around a key insight: **calendars are not just outputs of planning—they're also vital context for decision-making**.

**For Users:** Chronologue provides a transparent interface for reviewing past interactions, scheduling future events, and coordinating actions over time—designed for reliability and clarity in daily workflows.

**For Developers:** Its local-first design and schema-driven architecture ensure memory traces can be validated, edited, and synchronized consistently across calendar systems.

## Core Components

- **Memory Trace Ingestion**  
    Structured memory traces (JSON) capturing tasks, reflections, goals, or events are ingested through a standardized API format.
    
- **Validation Layer**  
    All traces are validated against a strict schema to ensure consistency, completeness, and compatibility with calendar event standards ([RFC 5545](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545)).
    
- **ICS Generation Engine**  
    Memory traces are transformed into `.ics` events with properly formatted timestamps, UID generation, summaries, descriptions, and optional metadata fields (location, attendees).
    
- **Editing and Previewing**  
    Generated events can be edited in place, with Markdown previews for human-friendly review before synchronization.    

- **Calendar Synchronization Modules**  
    Built-in modules allow direct syncing with:
    
    - Google Calendar API (OAuth2 authorized)
        
    - Apple Calendar (local `.ics` import or native API integration)
        
- **Agent Compatibility**  

    Chronologue provides a foundation for conversational agents and memory-grounded planners to operate over real-world time constraints, enabling "memory-to-action" pipelines in autonomous systems.
