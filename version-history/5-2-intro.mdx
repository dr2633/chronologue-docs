Chronologue is a platform for turning structured memory (e.g., conversation history) into scheduled events using calendar APIs—enabling retrieval, coordination, and planning.

It supports a bidirectional link between calendars and language models: events are generated from memory traces, and calendars in turn provide context for agent reasoning and decision-making.

**The core goal of Chronologue is to give users and organizations agency and autonomy — the ability to steer memory and agent behavior through a familiar, editable interface: the calendar.**

**For Users** 

Chronologue provides an accessible interface for reviewing past interactions, scheduling future events, and coordinating actions over time—designed for reliability and clarity in daily workflows.

**For Developers** 

Chronologue works on your local device and uses clear data structures and function calls, making it easy to check, edit, and sync your calendar information reliably across calendar apps.

## Core Components

- **Memory Trace Ingestion**  
    Structured memory traces (JSON) capturing tasks, reflections, goals, or events are ingested through a standardized API format.
    
- **Validation Layer**  
    All traces are validated against a strict schema to ensure consistency, completeness, and compatibility with calendar event standards ([RFC 5545](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545)).
    
- **ICS Generation Engine**  
    Memory traces are transformed into `.ics` events with properly formatted timestamps, UID generation, summaries, descriptions, and optional metadata fields (location, attendees).
    
- **Editing and Previewing**  
    Generated events can be edited in place, with Markdown previews for human-friendly review before synchronization.    

- **Calendar Synchronization Modules**  
    Built-in modules allow direct syncing with:
    
    - Google Calendar API (OAuth2 authorized)
        
    - Apple Calendar (local `.ics` import or native API integration)

    - Microsoft Graph and Outlook Calendar API 
        
- **Agent Compatibility**  

    Chronologue provides a foundation for conversational agents and memory-grounded planners to operate over real-world time constraints, enabling "memory-to-action" pipelines in autonomous systems.

## Purpose 


Chronologue gives you an accessible interface to review past interactions, plan upcoming events, and coordinate actions across time. It’s designed for reliability and clarity in daily workflows.


Chronologue works locally and uses structured data pipelines. Its typed schemas, validated APIs, and `.ics` generation tools make it easy to inspect, edit, customize, and sync memory and scheduled events across calendar platforms.
