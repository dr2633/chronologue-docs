Chronologue provides a set of example datasets to demonstrate how memory traces can be transformed into structured calendar events. These are useful for onboarding, testing new features, and exploring integrations between natural language prompts and `.ics` scheduling.

##  Directory Structure

All datasets are located in the `data/datasets/` directory. Each dataset includes:

- A `.json` file with memory traces
- A corresponding `.ics` file generated by Chronologue
- A markdown summary with notes or prompts
