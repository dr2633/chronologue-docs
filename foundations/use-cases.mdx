###  **Orchestration Over Time**

Agents are not stateless responders—they maintain continuity across sessions by integrating with the MCP timeline. This enables:

- **Multi-Session Follow-Up**  
    E.g., after `"Submit IRB application"`, agent checks status next week:  
    `"Do you want to schedule time to write the response letter?"`
    
- **Memory-Conditioned Suggestions**  
    Agents reason from past traces:  
    `"You typically do writing blocks at 10am—want to block time for this paper?"`
    
- **Cross-Context Consistency**  
    Goal and reflection traces ensure continuity:  
    `"You’ve been revisiting this topic for 3 weeks—shall we review progress?"`

This model supports **persistent, evolving plans**, giving users control over their own actions and the actions agents take on their behalf. Agents behave more like long-term collaborators—reasoning from user-defined context, adapting over time, and aligning with user goals.

By anchoring this interaction in a familiar interface, Cursor Calendar bridges the gap between natural language intent and structured planning—making it accessible to everyday users while enabling developers to orchestrate complex, multi-agent systems in production.

#### Dataset Curation 

| Use Case            | Memory Type   | Core Structure                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Grocery Scheduling  | `OrderMemory` | Items, quantities, approval times, delivery windows    |
| Sports Scheduling   | `EventMemory` | Team name, event date/time, opponent, link to watch    |
| Conversation Memory | `ChatMemory`  | Timestamped message history, link to full conversation |

| Name          | Purpose                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OrderMemory` | Structured memory for recurring physical item needs (e.g., groceries)                |
| `ChatMemory`  | Structured memory from conversational history                                        |
| `EventMemory` | Structured memory for scheduled future events (sports, reservations, meetings, etc.) |
