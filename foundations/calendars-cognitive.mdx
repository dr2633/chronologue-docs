#### Calendars as Cognitive Interfaces (Externalized Memory)

Tool development has massive compounding interest in evolution. 

Simple interfaces scale. 

Calendars are not just for meetings — they scaffold and externalize memory -- providing a tool for planning and coordinating action across individuals and groups.

Most people already use calendars to manage daily tasks, structure long-term goals, and collaborate with others. They offer a familiar and accessible interface for externalizing intent over time.

Crucially, calendars are well-suited for integration with intelligent systems:

- **APIs are widely available** (e.g., Google Calendar, iCal)
- **Scheduling aligns naturally with language** — e.g., “remind me,” “block off time,” “move to next week”, "summarize events from last Tuesday", etc. 
- **Voice and chat-based prompts** map cleanly onto calendar operations

Despite this, calendars remain underutilized as interfaces for organizing prior conversation history, planning future events, and **coordination tools for managing and grounding agents in user context. Most systems still treat scheduling as an endpoint—not as a structured context for shared reasoning and planning.
