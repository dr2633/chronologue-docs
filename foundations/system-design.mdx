System Design: Chronologue + MCP 

Chronologue integrates structured memory traces, natural language input, and calendar-based coordination through a unified interface. It relies on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to connect user input with event memory, agent reasoning, and calendar output.

**Event Schema**

All memory traces are converted into structured events, enabling both human review and agent planning. The core event types include:

- `goal` – a future-oriented intent ("Finish literature review")
    
- `observation` – a passive or descriptive record ("Met with advisor")
    
- `reflection` – a qualitative note or summary ("Need to prioritize data cleanup")
    
- `scheduled_event` – a time-bound commitment ("Lab sync at 2PM Thursday")
    
Example (backend JSON trace format):

```
{
  "type": "goal",
  "title": "Submit IRB application",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-24T09:00:00",
  "duration": 60,
  "linked_memory": ["trace_041", "trace_038"],
  "notes": "Dependent on finishing protocol write-up"
}
```

**MCP Integration**

MCP provides the scaffolding to structure agent interaction across time. Key mechanisms:

- **Memory Trace Ingestion**  

    Conversational input is parsed into structured trace entries (goal, reflection, etc.)
    
- **Timeline Generation**  

    MCP organizes these traces into a coherent timeline—annotated with metadata and available for `.ics` export.
    
- **Conversational Routing**  
    Chat commands like `"schedule a writing block tomorrow"` are interpreted into:
    
    - Actionable event traces
        
    - `.ics` entries
        
    - Planning context for future agent tasks



    **Calendar API Bridge**

Calendar interoperability is a core feature. MCP can generate and ingest:

- **`.ics` files** – Standards-compliant events compatible with Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook
    
- **Google Calendar API** – OAuth-authenticated event sync for read/write access
    
- **Structured Event I/O** – Sync back updated events into memory system for trace consistency

```
User Input → MCP → Trace Schema (Goal/Reflection/Event)
           → Timeline Assembly → .ics Export
           → Calendar Render → Agent Action

**User Interface and Editable Markdown Table**

This is how the Chronologue interface is rendered in a chat-based or UI-driven interaction—clear, editable, and structured for both human interaction and `.ics` export:


```
| Time           | Task                      | Notes                          |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 07:30–08:00    | Morning routine           | Stretching, quick shower       |
| 08:00–09:00    | Breakfast + Reading       | Light news or book time        |
| 09:00–12:00    | Focus work block          | Deep work, no distractions     |
| 12:00–13:00    | Lunch                     | Away from desk                 |
| 13:00–15:00    | Meetings                  | Check calendar for links       |
| 15:00–15:30    | Break                     | Walk or coffee                 |
| 15:30–17:00    | Admin & Emails            | Inbox zero, light tasks        |
| 17:00–18:00    | Workout                   | Gym or at-home routine         |
| 18:00–19:00    | Dinner                    | Relaxed, no screens            |
| 19:00–21:00    | Personal time / Projects  | Hobbies, learning, side work   |
| 21:00–22:00    | Wind-down routine         | Read, reflect, sleep prep      |
```

This format can be edited via chat, programmatically parsed into `.ics` events, and be pushed back into the MCP memory system as scheduled traces.
