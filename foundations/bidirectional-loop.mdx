title: "Language Models and Calendars"
description: "Chronologue is designed around a key insight: **calendars are not just outputs—they're critical context**."

By connecting language models to structured calendar systems, Chronologue enables agents to:

- **Generate** calendar events from natural language memory traces (e.g., goals, reflections, observations).
- **Ground** responses and plans in real-world schedules, time constraints, and commitments.
- **Update** calendars with new structured events based on conversation context.
- **Retrieve** time-based context to improve coherence, relevance, and coordination in agent outputs.

This bidirectional loop ensures that both humans and agents can coordinate over time with transparency and adaptability.


Built for both user workflows and AI-driven agent scheduling, it transforms structured conversational histories, goals, observations, and planned actions into validated `.ics` events—ready for synchronization with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and other platforms.
