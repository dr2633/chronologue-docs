### 4. Interaction Model 

Cursor Calendar enables users to collaborate with agents through a chat-based interface, with actions that directly manipulate a shared timeline. Agents interpret natural language prompts to schedule, reflect, reprioritize, and summarize—grounded in structured memory traces and calendar data.

### **Prompt Types and Agent Actions**

Agents respond to time-bound instructions and reflective queries by generating structured events and memory updates. Some examples:

- **Schedule Tasks**
    
    - `"Schedule a check-in every Friday at 10"`  
        → Creates recurring `scheduled_event` traces with linked metadata
        
- **Recall Activity**
    
    - `"What did I work on last week?"`  
        → Retrieves `goal` and `reflection` traces between defined timestamps
        
- **Reschedule with Constraints**
    
    - `"Reschedule lab sync based on everyone’s availability"`  
        → Queries external calendars, adjusts `scheduled_event`, updates memory trace
        
- **Summarize Patterns**
    
    - `"Summarize my week"`  
        → Groups recent goals, reflections, and tasks into a report-style memory output
