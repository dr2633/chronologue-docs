### 1. **Reflects Real Agent Usage**

Most meaningful interactions with calendar agents will begin from **natural language prompts**, not direct `.ics` inputs or structured tool calls.

- You’re simulating actual usage patterns: "schedule this", "move that", "when is..."
    
- It gives you a **direct path from interface → intent → execution**
    

### 2. **Tightly Couples Input with Outcome**

- You can easily test whether:
    
    - The prompt is interpreted correctly
        
    - The right event is created/modified/deleted
        
    - The output aligns with expected `.ics` structure
        

This makes it ideal for both **unit tests** and **end-to-end agent simulations**.

### 3. **Enables Dataset Generation + Fine-tuning**

- You can generate a dataset of (prompt → event structure) pairs
    
- Fine-tune or supervise the Cursor Calendar agent with examples like:
    
    - Input: “Cancel my sync with Max tomorrow”
        
    - Target JSON: (event details to delete)
        

### 4. **Gives You Flexibility to Inject Memory**

Prompt-centric workflows let you condition agent behavior on prior traces:

- “Didn’t I already book lunch on Thursday?”
    
- “Move that reflection I wrote after the RA meeting”
    

This ties directly into the **MCP memory layer**.


By grounding your agent in conversational prompts, you:

- Build a usable **interface abstraction**
    
- Keep your pipeline modular (chat → intent → planning tool → calendar)
    
- Allow future agents (Claude, GPT, custom planner) to act through MCP in a consistent way

**Develop a lightweight conversation-to-action test harness**, where each test includes:

- `user_input`: natural language prompt
    
- `expected_tool_call`: e.g., `sync_traces_to_google([event])`
    
- `expected_event`: minimal structured event block
    

Use this both for:

- MCP simulation testing
    
- Agent tool call grounding (especially for Cursor/GPT/Claude)
