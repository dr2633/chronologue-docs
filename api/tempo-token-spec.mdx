# Tempo Tokens

Tempo tokens are structured, time-grounded annotations designed to encode temporal context directly into agent planning, memory, and inference pipelines. They offer a scalable, model-compatible interface for representing absolute, relative, and semantic time in Chronologue.

Unlike standard positional encodings used in transformers, tempo tokens embed calendar-aware, clock-aware, and recurrence-aware representations directly into memory traces and planning prompts.

---

## 1. Purpose

Language models lack inherent calendar and clock awareness.  
Tempo tokens aim to:

- Enable agents to reason about when something happened or should happen  
- Provide consistent temporal structure across planning, execution, and feedback  
- Allow LLMs to learn, predict, and align with realistic time constraints  
- Facilitate retrieval, summarization, and profiling by time  

---

## 2. Format and Field Integration

Tempo tokens are stored in memory traces as an array field:

| Field          | Type      | Description                                      |
|----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| tempo_tokens   | array     | List of tempo annotations for the trace         |

Example:

tempo_tokens: [  
  <tempo:2025-04-30T15:00Z>,  
  <tempo:Wednesday>,  
  <tempo:Afternoon>,  
  <tempo:duration-30min>,  
  <tempo:urgent>,  
  <tempo:handoff-required>  
]

These tokens are not inferred at runtime — they are generated at ingestion or export and may also be inserted during dataset construction for pretraining.

## 3. Token Categories and Examples

| Category        | Format Example                          | Description                                |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Datetime         | <tempo:2025-04-30T15:00Z>               | Absolute event anchor                      |
| Weekday          | <tempo:Monday>                          | Weekly structure awareness                 |
| Time of Day      | <tempo:Afternoon>                       | Circadian alignment                        |
| Duration         | <tempo:duration-45min>                  | Action span for scheduling                 |
| Deadline         | <tempo:deadline-2025-04-30T16:00Z>      | Future-oriented planning constraint        |
| Recurrence       | <tempo:recurring-weekly>                | Recurring task behavior                    |
| Urgency          | <tempo:urgent>                          | Task priority for planning agents          |
| Event Type       | <tempo:shipment>, <tempo:handoff>       | Task classification and routing            |
| Location         | <tempo:location-Lab3>                   | Spatial grounding                          |
| Relative Time    | <tempo:in-2h>, <tempo:past-1d>          | Temporal proximity or recency              |
| Availability     | <tempo:available>, <tempo:unavailable>  | Coordination constraint                    |
| Conflict         | <tempo:collision-2025-04-30T15:00Z>     | Scheduling conflict awareness              |

## 4. Generation Logic

Tempo tokens are generated from `.ics`-formatted calendar events and memory trace metadata using:

- `DTSTART`, `DTEND`, and `DURATION`  
- ISO timestamps (timestamp, scheduled_for, executed_at)  
- Task-specific metadata (e.g., location, completion_status, theme)  

Tempo tokens are included as part of:

- `.ics → JSON` conversion pipelines  
- memory/push or functions/call endpoints  
- Offline dataset construction for pretraining augmentation

---

## 5. Inference and Prompt Integration

Tempo tokens are injected into system prompts and planning inputs to align models with structured time.

Prompt Example:

Upcoming Event: Inbound Shipment  
<tempo:2025-04-30T15:00Z> <tempo:Wednesday> <tempo:Afternoon>  
<tempo:urgent> <tempo:deadline-2025-04-30T16:00Z> <tempo:handoff-required>  
<tempo:location-ReceivingDock3>

CoT Result:

Assign Priya. She is available from 14:00–18:00 and can manage the cold chain transfer before the 16:00 deadline. Prepare buffer storage in case of delay.

---

## 6. Validation and Token Registry

All tempo tokens must conform to a centralized registry to ensure standardization.

### Validation Rules:

- Token matches an approved category and format  
- Uses ISO 8601 for all datetime encodings  
- Category-specific rules are enforced (e.g., durations must be in whole minutes)

The API will reject or warn on invalid tokens during trace ingestion and `.ics` import.

Optional endpoint:

GET /tempo/tags → Returns list of valid token types and examples  
POST /tempo/generate → Generates tempo tokens from `.ics` or memory trace input

---

## 7. Use Cases

- Agent planning: infer scheduling feasibility from token tags  
- Profiling: compare actual execution time vs. planned token alignment  
- Summarization: extract temporally bounded trace windows  
- Feedback: evaluate plan performance using token-aligned outcomes  
- Scheduling: detect collisions, soft boundaries, and escalation paths

---

## 8. Best Practices

- Always include a base timestamp token for absolute anchoring  
- Use weekday and time-of-day for recurrence modeling  
- Apply urgency, recurrence, and deadline tags in structured plans  
- Validate token sets on ingestion or schedule preview  
- Align tempo tokens with calendar metadata and feedback outcomes
