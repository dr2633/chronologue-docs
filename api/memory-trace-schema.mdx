# Memory Trace Schema

Chronologue uses memory traces to represent structured information over time. These include user goals, reflections, system observations, and scheduled calendar events. Each trace is JSON-formatted and stored in a persistent memory store to support personalized planning, reflection, and agent reasoning.

---

## Memory Trace Types

Traces are typed objects with a shared core schema. The primary `type` values include:

### goal
Represents a user-defined intention or objective.  
- Example: "Finish CUDA tutorial this week"

### reflection
A personal insight or retrospective evaluation.  
- Example: "Morning exercise made my focus better today"

### observation
A system- or user-logged factual statement about activity or state.  
- Example: "Worked on writing sprint from 9:00 to 10:30"

### calendar_event
A scheduled or logged event that maps to an external calendar entry.  
- Example: "Meeting with research team at 3pm"

## Required and Optional Fields

Each trace includes the following fields:

| Field              | Type     | Required | Description |
|--------------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| uid                | string   | yes      | Unique identifier for the trace |
| type               | string   | yes      | One of: goal, reflection, observation, calendar_event |
| timestamp          | string   | yes      | ISO 8601 timestamp marking creation |
| content            | string   | yes      | Main text of the trace |
| task_id            | string   | no       | Optional grouping ID for multi-step tasks |
| theme              | string   | no       | Optional activity domain (e.g., fitness, learning, work) |
| action_type        | string   | no       | Specifies agent/system action: schedule, reflect, log, update, delete |
| importance         | number   | no       | Relative significance (0–1 float) |
| completion_status  | string   | no       | One of: pending, completed, skipped |
| linked_event_uid   | string   | no       | UID of associated calendar event (if applicable) |
| collaborators      | array    | no       | List of user IDs or names involved |
| feedback_rating    | number   | no       | User feedback score (1–5) |
| notes              | string   | no       | Freeform comments or review notes |

## Trace Lifecycle

### Creation
Traces are created:
- Automatically by LLMs after actions (e.g., scheduling a new event)
- Manually via user reflection or logging

Traces should always include a valid UID and timestamp at creation.

### Update
Fields like `completion_status`, `importance`, or `notes` can be updated over time as the task evolves or is reviewed.

### Archival
Traces may be archived (or soft-deleted) for filtering long-term memory. You may optionally add an `archived_at` timestamp.

---

## Linking Traces

### Event UID Linking
Traces of type `goal` or `reflection` can reference a `calendar_event` using the `linked_event_uid`. This enables synchronization between memory and scheduling contexts.

### Feedback Annotations
Users can provide feedback after a task:
- Was this time block helpful?
- Was this goal realistic?

This can be stored using `feedback_rating` or added to the `notes` field.

---

## Agent Action Metadata

To support filtering for model actions over time, use the optional `action_type` field. This helps distinguish between user-entered and model-generated traces and provides clarity in audits, learning loops, and structured logs.

### Common values for `action_type`

| Value       | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| schedule    | Agent added a new event to the calendar     |
| reschedule  | Agent moved an existing event               |
| reflect     | Agent generated a new reflection            |
| log         | System recorded a factual observation       |
| update      | Agent edited an existing trace              |
| delete      | Agent or user removed a trace or event      |

This enables querying: "What did the agent *do* today?" or "Which reflections were AI-generated?"

## Example Trace Payloads

### Reflection

{
  "uid": "trace-001",
  "type": "reflection",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-08T22:30:00Z",
  "content": "Evening planning helped me sleep easier.",
  "importance": 0.8,
  "action_type": "reflect"
}

### Calendar Event

{
  "uid": "evt-045",
  "type": "calendar_event",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-09T07:00:00Z",
  "content": "Upper body workout at Mission Cliffs",
  "linked_event_uid": "gcal-789abc",
  "completion_status": "completed",
  "theme": "fitness",
  "action_type": "schedule"
}

---

## Best Practices

- Use consistent formatting for timestamps (always UTC)
- Ensure `uid` is globally unique (e.g., UUIDv4 or prefixed)
- Link related traces by `linked_event_uid` or shared `task_id`
- Use `importance` and `completion_status` to guide agent decisions
- Use `action_type` to capture structured logs of agent reasoning and behavior
- Avoid overloading `content` – structure your data where possible
