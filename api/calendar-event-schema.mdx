title: "Calendar Event Schema"
---

## 1. Introduction

Chronologue supports converting memory traces into `.ics`-compliant calendar events for integration with platforms like Google Calendar and Apple Calendar. This allows agents and users to schedule actions with temporal grounding and persistent reminders.

Each calendar event is derived from a structured memory trace and formatted as a `VEVENT` block.

## 2. Core Fields

| Field            | Type     | Required | Description                                      |
|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `title`          | string   | ✓        | Human-readable label for the event               |
| `timestamp`      | ISO 8601 | ✓        | Start time (UTC) of the event                    |
| `duration_minutes` | int    | ✓        | Duration in minutes                              |
| `task_id`        | string   | ✓        | Unique identifier of originating memory trace    |
| `uid`            | string   | ✓        | UID used in `.ics` file                          |

## 3. Optional & Contextual Fields

| Field              | Type     | Description                                                |
|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `content`          | string   | Detailed description of the event                          |
| `tempo_tag`        | string   | Tempo classification (e.g., `@morning`, `30min_block`)     |
| `linked_event_uid` | string   | Use this to sync memory to a previously created event       |
| `chat_url`         | string   | Link to source conversation (if applicable)                |
| `location`         | string   | Physical or virtual location of the event                  |
| `completion_status`| string   | Optional: `completed`, `missed`, or `cancelled`            |
| `trigger_condition`| string   | Used for agent-triggered events (e.g. `if room is clean`)   |

## 4. Full Event Example

json
{
  "title": "Deep Work Block",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-12T09:00:00Z",
  "duration_minutes": 120,
  "task_id": "goal-2025-05-12-deep-work",
  "content": "Focus on writing and model evaluation.",
  "tempo_tag": "@morning 2hr_block",
  "chat_url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/example-link",
  "location": "Desk at home office",
  "linked_event_uid": "evt-20250512-deepwork"
}

## 5. `.ics` Mapping Logic

Chronologue uses a conversion utility like `generate_ics_string()` to produce a `VEVENT` block. Each field is safely escaped and formatted to comply with the iCalendar spec.

### Sample Output:

ics
BEGIN:VEVENT  
UID:evt-20250512-deepwork  
DTSTAMP:20250511T180000Z  
DTSTART:20250512T090000Z  
DTEND:20250512T110000Z  
SUMMARY:Deep Work Block  
DESCRIPTION:Focus on writing and model evaluation.\nChat log: https://chat.openai.com/share/example-link  
LOCATION:Desk at home office  
STATUS:CONFIRMED  
END:VEVENT

---

## 6. Validation Rules

- `timestamp` must be in valid ISO 8601 format and converted to UTC  
- `duration_minutes` must be ≥ 1  
- `title` is escaped to prevent comma/semicolon injection  
- `uid` must be globally unique per event (use `task_id + date`)  
- `description` supports newline + chat reference for traceability

---

## 7. Integration Notes

Chronologue calendar events can be:

- Exported to `.ics` files
- Synced to Google Calendar using the [Google Calendar Integration Guide](/Users/derekrosenzweig/Documents/GitHub/mintlify-docs/concepts/google-calendar.mdx)
- Referenced back to memory traces via `linked_event_uid`

Use this schema as a foundation for task planning, temporal triggers, and multi-agent synchronization in real-world environments.

Calendar events are more than reminders — they are a programmable, editable interface for agents operating across time, context, and memory.
