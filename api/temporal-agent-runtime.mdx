# Temporal Agent Runtime and Profiling

Chronologue is designed as a **temporal compiler for agent behavior**. Inspired by CUDA’s host-device execution model and profiling tools, the system enables users to write structured, time-aware plans, orchestrate agent actions, and evaluate performance over time through memory traces and structured feedback.

This architecture turns the calendar into a runtime coordination surface, where users don’t just schedule tasks—they program agents.

## 1. The Host-Device Model for Agents

Chronologue follows a model similar to CUDA’s host-device abstraction:

- **Host**: The user (or LLM planner) orchestrates work by defining agent plans and temporal intent.
- **Device**: The agent executes structured tasks like scheduling events, writing reflections, or logging activities.
- **Queue**: Proposed actions wait in the planner queue until approved and scheduled for execution.
- **Profiler**: Logs traceable performance and alignment data to support adaptive behavior.

### Mapping Concepts

| Chronologue Role | CUDA Analogy | Description |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `agent_plan`     | Kernel Launch | Encapsulates a task and when to execute it |
| `executor`       | GPU threads   | Performs the action according to plan |
| `tempo_token`    | Stream config | Temporal granularity and alignment metadata |
| `profiling`      | Nsight/CUPTI  | Logs execution time, accuracy, and feedback |

## 2. Compiler + Runtime Pipeline

Chronologue functions like a temporal DSL + execution system:

- **Plan**: User or agent defines action (`agent_plan`) with scheduling metadata
- **Schedule**: The system resolves `tempo_token`, checks constraints, and queues execution
- **Execute**: An executor runs the agent behavior and commits resulting memory traces
- **Profile**: Execution is logged with metadata like `executed_at`, `deviation_ms`, and `feedback_score`

This system enables composable planning, reliable delegation, and feedback-driven improvement of agent performance over time.

---

## 3. Agent Execution and Trace Profiling

After each agent action is executed, the system records **profiling metadata** to support:

- **Auditing**: What happened, when, and how closely did it match the plan?
- **Learning**: Was the result helpful? Did the user approve or revise?
- **Scheduling feedback**: Was the execution on time, early, or delayed?

Profiling metadata may include:

- `executed_at`: timestamp of actual execution
- `tempo_alignment`: comparison against intended token
- `feedback_score`: user rating
- `duration_ms`, `deviation_ms`

For a full field-by-field specification and implementation guide, see the [Trace Profiling Schema](./trace_profiling_schema).

## 4. Repository Organization for DSL + Runtime

To build and maintain this architecture, organize the Chronologue repo as follows:

```
chronologue/  
├── schemas/  
│ ├── agent_plan.py  
│ ├── feedback_trace.py  
│ └── profiling.py  
├── runtime/  
│ ├── scheduler.py  
│ ├── executor.py  
│ ├── profiler.py  
│ └── queue.py  
├── tempo/  
│ └── tokens.py  
├── api/  
│ ├── routes_agent.py  
│ └── routes_feedback.py  
├── frontend/  
│ ├── components/AgentQueuePanel.tsx  
│ ├── components/FeedbackModal.tsx  
│ └── components/ProfilerTimeline.tsx
```

This separation cleanly supports DSL definition, plan scheduling, runtime execution, and result introspection.

## 5. Summary

Chronologue is not just a scheduler—it is a **temporal programming interface for agents**. By modeling the orchestration of behavior over time, it provides:

- Programmability: composable intent with runtime guarantees
- Auditability: every agent action is logged and reviewable
- Adaptivity: agent plans evolve based on profiling and feedback

For runtime to be trustworthy, it must be traceable. The combination of memory traces and execution profiling is what enables scalable, safe agent behavior over time.
