## Introduction

Chronologue’s API is designed for async, agent-oriented workflows, supporting structured memory traces, personalized scheduling, and context-aware planning. It integrates a **FastAPI-based backend** with an **OpenAPI-standardized interface**, ensuring clear documentation, robust validation, and multi-agent interoperability.

---

## FastAPI as the Implementation Layer

Chronologue uses **FastAPI** to:

- Define async RESTful endpoints  
- Validate input with Pydantic models  
- Support dependency injection and security  
- Serve automatic OpenAPI docs at `/docs` and `/openapi.json`  

This enables developers to build reliable, high-performance backend logic with Python typing and schema introspection.

## OpenAPI as the Documentation & Contract Layer

Chronologue adopts **OpenAPI** (v3) as its standard for describing:

- Endpoint paths and HTTP methods  
- Request/response schemas  
- Authentication headers and error codes  
- Parameter validation and types  

This makes the API:

- **Self-describing**: clients can auto-generate code  
- **Interoperable**: integrates with external tools, agents, and platforms  
- **Testable**: contract-first development supports mock testing and inspection  

---

## Design Goals

Chronologue’s API is designed to be:

- **Composable** – Endpoints map cleanly to memory, planning, and execution layers  
- **Asynchronous** – All server logic is non-blocking and concurrency-safe  
- **Transparent** – Each endpoint returns structured metadata, diagnostics, and traceable results  
- **Memory-first** – Chronologue uses structured traces as its primary data model across planning and reflection

## Development and Usage Workflow

1. **Build endpoints in FastAPI**  
   Define routes, schemas, and business logic using async def functions.

2. **Expose OpenAPI schema**  
   FastAPI auto-generates `/openapi.json`, used by Swagger, Redoc, and external SDKs.

3. **Document endpoints in `.mdx` files**  
   Use OpenAPI-style syntax to explain behavior, parameters, examples, and use cases.

4. **Sync updates across tools**  
   Keep `.mdx` docs aligned with backend versioning and testing suites.

Chronologue’s API is not just a way to call functions — it is a **contract for persistent memory, time-grounded planning, and traceable agent coordination**. Designed for multi-agent, human-in-the-loop systems.
