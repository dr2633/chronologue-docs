Chronologue** is a memory-grounded scheduling and reasoning framework that converts structured and conversational inputs into `.ics` calendar files, integrating natural language understanding with time-aware planning. The project is designed to serve as an interface between large language models (LLMs) and real-world time, enabling agents to reason about and coordinate actions based on structured calendar events.
