title: "Agent Orchestration Interface (AOI)"
group: "Concepts"
---

Chronologue treats time not just as a resource to manage, but as an API for managing and coordinating actions. 

The agent orchestration interface is designed to help users **audit, steer, and schedule agent behavior** directly through the calendar. This system makes agent actions **auditable**, **controllable**, and **programmable**, giving users an interface to assign responsibility to agents in the same way one might call a ride, schedule a delivery, or block time with a collaborator.

Unlike passive logging or simple model output, Chronologue anchors agent actions in time with explicit control over **when** and **how long** the action should take. This introduces precision into task specification and empowers users to compose systems of intent with temporal constraints.

Chronologue reimagines the calendar as a **control surface** for agentic workflows. As language models gain more general capabilities, there is an expanding need for interfaces that make model behaviors **legible, modifiable, and schedulable**. Chronologue is built to meet that need.

## 1. System Roles and Components

- **User**: Initiates prompts, reviews or edits agent-generated plans, and gives feedback.
- **Agent**: Generates structured plans (e.g., `add_event`, `reflect`, `reschedule_event`) using model outputs.
- **Planner Queue**: Holds proposed agent actions awaiting user confirmation.
- **Executor**: Commits approved plans into persistent memory and/or calendar.
- **Trace Log**: Immutable record of both agent proposals and user decisions.

In the future, everyone will be a builder and manager. Access to tools and information will be ubiquitous—but not all interfaces will offer the same leverage. Agent orchestration is how we build utility at human scale.

## 2. Agent Action Lifecycle

Every agent action flows through a defined lifecycle to support transparency, modification, and feedback:

- **proposal**: Agent generates an initial plan, often via function calling from an LLM.
- **review**: Plan is displayed to the user for inspection or editing.
- **approval**: User confirms the plan or modifies it to fit their intent.
- **execution**: Approved plan is committed to memory and/or calendar.
- **feedback**: Optional user input (rating, revision, comment) is logged to guide future behavior.

### Status Transitions

- `proposed` → `approved` → `executed`
- `proposed` → `rejected`
- `executed` → `edited`

Each transition is recorded as a memory trace, preserving full behavioral provenance.

## 3. Trace Structure for Orchestration

Agent behavior is recorded and governed via structured memory traces. A special type of trace, `agent_plan`, extends the general schema with orchestration-specific fields.

### Required Fields

| Field           | Type     | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| `action_type`    | string   | One of: schedule, reflect, reschedule, log |
| `status`         | string   | One of: proposed, approved, rejected, executed |
| `origin`         | string   | One of: agent, user |
| `scheduled_for`  | string   | Optional ISO timestamp representing intended execution time |
| `uid`            | string   | Unique identifier for trace reference |

### Trace Linking

- `agent_plan` traces may link to `calendar_event` or `reflection` traces that result from their execution.
- Use fields like `linked_event_uid` or `child_trace_ids` to maintain referential integrity.

## 4. Orchestration UI Patterns

Chronologue includes several interface modules to manage agent behavior interactively:

- **Daily Agent Preview**: Shows all pending proposed actions, with accept/reject controls.
- **Command Log**: Timeline of all agent outputs and user decisions, chronologically sorted.
- **Editable Plan Workspace**: UI that allows drag-and-drop reordering, rescheduling, or editing of proposed actions.
- **Feedback Modal**: Allows users to rate or comment on specific agent behaviors, improving downstream suggestions.

These patterns ensure agents are observable and influenceable—core requirements for high-trust collaboration.

## 5. Feedback Loop, Behavior Adaptation, RL, Federated Learning

The orchestration system supports structured feedback and adaptation.

- `feedback_rating` and `notes` can be applied to any trace.
- Feedback can be linked to the `agent_plan` UID to trace behavioral outcomes.
- Longitudinal analysis of approved/rejected traces can drive:
  - Reward modeling
  - Reinforcement learning (e.g., via success/failure tags)
  - Federated updates to personalized planning models

Feedback is not ephemeral—it's written to memory for reuse.

---

## 6. Scheduling and User Customization

User constraints are enforced and communicated to agents through scheduling metadata:

- **Time as a constraint interface**: Only allow agents to propose actions during unblocked slots.
- **User-defined cadence**: Set rules for how often agents can propose certain actions (e.g., 1 reflection per day).
- **Discrete allocation**: Agents may be limited to a budget of actions per day or week, modifiable by the user.
- **Prompt context injection**: Availability and user preferences are embedded in model inputs.

## 7. Implementation Notes

Chronologue uses the following system architecture for orchestration:

### FastAPI Endpoints

- `POST /agent/plan` — submit an agent proposal
- `GET /agent/queue` — retrieve pending plans
- `POST /agent/approve` — approve a specific plan
- `POST /agent/reject` — reject a specific plan
- `POST /agent/feedback` — log feedback to a specific trace

### Frontend Sync

- Use WebSockets or polling to synchronize planner queue and user approvals in real time.

### System Separation

Modular separation is recommended:

- **Memory Trace Store**: All long-term memory and behavior logs
- **Calendar Event Store**: Ground-truth schedule and event registry
- **Agent Queue Store**: Temporary buffer for proposals pending execution

This separation enables caching, rollback, and traceability of agent behavior at different lifecycle stages.
