title: 'Export Calendar (ICS)'
---

## Overview

Chronologue's event generation pipeline converts structured memory traces (`.json`) into calendar events (`.ics`) following the iCalendar standard. This allows natural language input to produce concrete, time-aligned actions in external scheduling systems.

The core script powering this transformation is `modules/export_ics.py`.



---

## Gold Standard: `.ics` Format

Chronologue conforms to a minimal but valid iCalendar `VEVENT` structure:

```ics
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:lab_ops-20240407@memorysystem.ai
DTSTAMP:20250401T080000Z
DTSTART:20240407T090000Z
DTEND:20240407T091500Z
SUMMARY:Temperature in incubator #3 drifted 1.5°C above target during morning run.
DESCRIPTION:Temperature in incubator #3 drifted 1.5°C above target during morning run.
LOCATION:wetlab_sync
STATUS:CONFIRMED
END:VEVENT
```

All fields are derived from the memory trace or inferred via defaults. A working .ics is generated using:


```
ics_string = generate_ics_string(memory_trace)
```


1. Loads .json memory trace files

2. Validates trace entries

3. Generates VEVENTs

4. Writes a consolidated `.ics` calendar


### Key Functions and Parameters for Customization

`resolve_duration_minutes(trace)`

- Parses flexible user duration formats: 2h, 30m, 1:00-2:30, or "one hour"

- Customize: Default duration (currently 30), upper bound, parsing logic

`generate_uid(title, date)`

- Constructs a globally unique UID from task ID and date

- Customize: Change UID domain, format, or link to external systems

`generate_summary_title(content)`

- Uses OpenAI to create a concise SUMMARY field

- Fallbacks to truncating raw content if LLM fails

Customize: Model, max length, prompt template

`generate_ics_string(trace)`

- Assembles a VEVENT from a single memory trace

- Includes SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, LOCATION, DTSTART, DTEND, UID, STATUS

`write_consolidated_ics(events, output_path)`

- Writes header, VEVENT blocks, and footer into a single .ics file
- Customize: PRODID, versioning metadata, newline style (Windows/iCal)

### Opportunities for Personalization

- Chronologue encourages local customization for different user or organization memory systems:

- Duration interpretation for different workflows (e.g. lab vs. meetings)

- LLM-based title summarization vs. rules-based

- Structured description fields for reflection, chat links, metadata

- Custom UID namespaces for cross-platform syncing

- Flexible timestamp parsing and formatting

**Testing Output Format**

Use test_ics_format() to generate a sample .ics file and validate against the expected template:

```
python modules/export_ics.py
```

This writes a file test_output.ics to inspect the generated format against the gold standard.
