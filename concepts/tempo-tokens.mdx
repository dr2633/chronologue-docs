title: 'Tempo Tokens'
---

Tempo tokens are time-grounded embeddings or annotations that represent temporal structure — explicitly encoding timing, recurrence, and duration into a model’s input at inference time.

Think of them as positional encodings, but for real-world time—not just token order.

**Time-Aware Transformers**  

Transformers today use fixed or learned positional encodings that reflect the order of tokens during training. That works well for language, but it doesn’t capture semantic time—like the difference between _Monday 3PM_ and _Saturday 10AM_.  
There’s currently no built-in way to represent:

- Recurring events
    
- Temporal gaps or proximity
    
- Day-of-week or time-of-day patterns
    
- Future planning vs past reasoning
    

**Language Models Lack Clock and Calendar Awareness**  
While LLMs can talk about time, they don’t _use_ time as part of their internal context.  They don’t know when something happened. They don’t model how long real-world events take. And they have no sense of what’s coming next unless it’s explicitly mentioned in a prompt.

This limits their ability to plan, coordinate, or help users manage real-time tasks.  By grounding model inputs in structured time—especially using external sources like `.ics` calendar data—we can start to bridge this gap and build agents that better understand the temporal context their users inhabit.


**Proposed Function of Tempo Tokens**

At training or inference, tempo tokens can be inserted as special annotations that; 

- Encode **absolute time**: @2025-04-30T14:00Z
- Encode **relative time**: `@+3d`, `@past-1w`
- Encode **calendar structure**: `@Monday`, `@weekend`, `@EoQ`
- Encode **rhythmic recurrence**: `@biweekly`, `@every-Tuesday`

These could be actual tokens (`<tempo:mon_14_00>`) or embedded features added via a side-channel (like extra inputs in fine-tuning or adapters).

Enables user adaptability and specification for agent tasks 

**Training-Time Augmentation**

Use `.ics` or calendar data to:

- Inject time-structured context into dialogue or task completion datasets.
    
- Align text spans with event timing and sequence (e.g., doctor notes, project logs).
    
- Generate training examples where **temporal cues improve performance** on downstream tasks (planning, scheduling, coordination, summarization).

Example 

Transform 
```txt
Submit payroll to HR next Tuesday May 13th. 
```

into: 

```txt
"Submit payroll to HR. <tempo:due-2025-05-01> <tempo:project-deadline>"
```

**Inference-Time Augmentation**

At inference: 

- Inject known temporal signals from `.ics` context into the prompt to improve grounding 

- Align responses with upcoming events, time constraints, or temporal reasoning goals 

- Enable planning agents to prioritize actions in realistic and user-defined time horizons

**Use Cases with `.ics` Integration**

**Chronologue Command Agent**

- Converts `.ics` entries into tempo tokens for prompt construction
- Use upcoming event timing to suggest actions, order and organize tasks, detect and manage conflicts in scheduling

**Reasoning and CoT**

- Tempo tokens give context to memory traces: when it happened, how often, what comes next 

**Time-Aware Retrieval and Summarization**

- "Summarize the last week's events" --> uses tempo-annotated memory traces to construct a coherent and verifiable narrative 

***

Feasibility: 

- Can be done without architecture changes using adapter layers or embedding projection (to link events in chronological time) 
- Using time as an index dimension 

Logistically: 

- `.ics` data is structured and timestamped, making it the ideal import format for tempo token generation -- assembling largescale datasets and synthetic datasets
- Many existing datasets (project logs, Github commits, emails) could be aligned with time

Showcasing how an `.ics` calendar event can be parsed into tempo tokens -- these tokens can be retrieved to augment inference-time system-level prompts for temporally grounded chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. 

1. Sample `.ics` Event 

```ics
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:shipment-arrival-20250430T150000Z@chronologue.ai
DTSTAMP:20250429T120000Z
DTSTART:2025-04-30T15:00:00Z
DTEND:2025-04-30T15:30:00Z
SUMMARY:Inbound Shipment — Med Supplies (Batch #23B)
LOCATION:Receiving Dock 3
DESCRIPTION:Urgent delivery. Requires cold chain transfer to Storage A by 16:00.
END:VEVENT
```

2. Structured Event JSON 

```json
{
  "uid": "shipment-arrival-20250430T150000Z@logistics.ai",
  "title": "Inbound Shipment — Med Supplies (Batch #23B)",
  "start": "2025-04-30T15:00:00Z",
  "end": "2025-04-30T15:30:00Z",
  "location": "Receiving Dock 3",
  "description": "Urgent delivery. Requires cold chain transfer to Storage A by 16:00."
}
```

3. Tempo Tokens for Inference Context 


```txt
<tempo:2025-04-30T15:00Z>
<tempo:Wednesday>
<tempo:Afternoon>
<tempo:shipment>
<tempo:urgent>
<tempo:deadline-2025-04-30T16:00Z>
<tempo:location-ReceivingDock3>
<tempo:handoff-required>
```


These tokens give the agent:

- Exact time of arrival
    
- Deadline for transfer
    
- Event type (`shipment`)
    
- Urgency and task completion constraints
    
- Location grounding

4. Injected CoT Prompt for Temporal Reasoning 

Prompt: 

```
You are coordinating logistics for medical shipments. Use the schedule below to assign responsibilities and detect any conflicts or risks.
```

System Prompt 

```txt
Upcoming Event:
Inbound Shipment — Med Supplies (Batch #23B)
<tempo:2025-04-30T15:00Z> <tempo:Wednesday> <tempo:Afternoon>
<tempo:urgent> <tempo:deadline-2025-04-30T16:00Z> <tempo:handoff-required>
<tempo:location-ReceivingDock3>

Current cold chain staff availability:
- Luis (shift ends at 15:15)
- Priya (available 14:00–18:00)
- Forklift 1 in use until 14:55

Recent delivery delays: 12–18 min average at Receiving Dock 3
```


Simulated Chain-of-Thought Output 
```
The shipment is scheduled for 15:00 with a cold chain deadline at 16:00. Luis’s shift ends too early to ensure delivery, so Priya should be assigned. There’s a risk of a 12–18 minute delay at Receiving Dock 3, which means backup cold chain gear should be pre-cooled in Storage A. Forklift 1 will be available in time for transfer. Assign Priya and notify Receiving Dock to prioritize unloading.
```

### **Inference Benefits**

Tempo tokens allow the model to:

- Predictively allocate resources based on event timing
    
- Reason about deadlines, urgency, and gaps
    
- Align agents (human or AI) with scheduled activity
    
- Anticipate failure modes (e.g., delays, shift coverage, equipment availability)
