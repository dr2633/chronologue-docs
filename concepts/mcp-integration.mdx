title: 'Model Context Protocol (MCP)'
---

## Overview

Chronologue integrates the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) to enable structured memory access, event scheduling, and tool invocation via standardized agent interfaces.

This implementation supports:

- Serving memory traces over a FastAPI or stdio MCP server
- Scheduling calendar events through Google Calendar API
- Converting `.json` memory traces to `.ics` format
- Running OpenAI or Claude-based ReAct loops to populate and update the calendar

## MCP Server Setup

The server exposes tools and resources via either `stdio_server` or `FastMCP` (FastAPI-based):

- **Tool: `sync_to_google_calendar`**  
  Sync `.json` memory traces to a Google Calendar  
- **Tool: `generate_embedding`**  
  Generate OpenAI embeddings for trace content  
- **Tool: `convert_trace_to_ics`**  
  Convert memory trace to `.ics` string for calendar export  

Scripts:
- `server.py` (stdio server)
- `server_google_calendar.py` (FastAPI)

Run with:

```
python mcp/server.py  
```
or  

```
python mcp/server_google_calendar.py
```

## MCP Client: Chat + Tool Invocation

The client connects to the MCP server, lists available tools, and forwards user queries through a Claude (or OpenAI) chat loop.

Key features:
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet API with tools attached
- Handles tool calls like `sync_to_google_calendar`, embedding generation
- Supports a full interactive REPL

Script:
- `client.py`

Run with:

```
python mcp/client.py 
```

## Calendar Tooling and Integration

Chronologue exposes structured tools to bridge memory traces and calendar APIs:

### Key Tools

- `convert_trace_to_ics(trace: dict) -> str`  
  Converts a single memory trace into a VEVENT-compliant `.ics` string

- `sync_traces_to_google(traces: list[dict]) -> str`  
  Sends memory traces to Google Calendar using OAuth-authenticated API

- `load_memory_file(file_path: str) -> list[dict]`  
  Loads structured memory from a `.json` file

Defined in:
- `server_google_calendar.py`

Google Calendar setup requires:
- `calendar/credentials.json`
- `calendar/token.json`

Scopes used:  
`['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar']`

## MCP Resources

Memory traces can be exposed as structured resources via MCP:

- `calendar://pending_goals`  
  All `goal`-type memory traces with `completion_status: pending`

- `calendar://week_summary/{iso_week}`  
  All traces from the specified ISO week (`2025-W18`)

- `calendar://trace_by_id/{trace_id}`  
  Lookup a specific memory trace by ID

These allow downstream agents or apps to reflect, plan, or retrieve specific event blocks.

## Agent Loop (Planner + Executor)

Chronologue supports integration with OpenAI or Claude models to generate schedules:

1. Query the MCP server for memory or context blocks  
2. Pass them into a prompt:  
   _"Given the user's upcoming goals and availability, what events should be scheduled this week?"_  
3. Receive a response in the form of `MCPContextBlock(type="calendar_event")`
4. Sync to calendar using tools

This loop is defined in the `process_query()` and `chat_loop()` methods of the `MCPClient`.

## Optional: Custom UI for Calendar + Agent Logs

For deeper integration or review:

- **Top panel**: MCP-derived upcoming events  
- **Side panel**: agent chat logs and memory trace history  
- **Bottom panel**: annotate traces, schedule goals, or trigger planner  

Tools:
- `Streamlit` or `Flet` for simple UI prototyping  
- `Tempo Tokens`, feedback inputs, and calendar visualizations

## Example Usage

Run the FastAPI-based MCP server and query events for the week:

python server_google_calendar.py  
curl http://localhost:8000/context?type=calendar_event&last_n=5

Trigger syncing memory to calendar:

```
python mcp/client.py 
python mcp/server.py  
```

# Then: Type "Sync last session to calendar"

## Summary

Chronologueâ€™s MCP backend provides a powerful interface for:

- Agent reflection, planning, and memory access  
- Tool invocation via structured protocols  
- Real-world event scheduling grounded in memory  
- Integrating `.ics`, `.json`, and calendar APIs in a unified loop

Use MCP as the bridge between memory traces, LLM agents, and the real-world temporal context.
