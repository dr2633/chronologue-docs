## 1. Introduction: Why Causal Trace Linking Matters

Using memory to understand causality is **foundational** for self-observation and agentic behavior. You're not just logging data — you're building a structured memory model that supports narrative explanations, traceable outcomes, and future alignment.

This section defines how to formally encode causal relationships across memory traces and introduces tools for evaluating follow-through, deviation, and behavioral drift.

---

## 2. Causal Attribution with Memory Traces

Chronologue supports building causal chains in memory:

- `goal → action → observation → reflection`

This enables reasoning over:

- “Did I do what I said I’d do?”  
- “What changed between intention and outcome?”  
- “What influenced my decision to deviate?”

These traces form **causal scaffolds** that go beyond correlation—grounded in timestamped decisions, not abstract trends.

---

## 3. Structuring LLM-Readable Causal Chains

LLMs struggle with causality unless sequences are made explicit.

By structuring traces with `linked_trace_ids` and temporal anchors, Chronologue enables agents to reason over:

- Goals and their downstream effects
- Environmental or internal interruptions
- Reflections tied to failed or revised plans

This makes agents not just predictive, but **explainable** and **adaptive**.

---

## 4. Memory as a Substrate for Intervention

Causal memory enables intervention:

- What patterns predict follow-through?
- Which conditions lead to avoidance or revision?
- How can I revise plans to yield better results?

This becomes possible because:

- **Intent is stored** (`goal`, `scheduled_for`)
- **Outcome is measured** (`observation`, `reflection`)
- **Review is structured** (`linked_trace_ids`, `completion_status`)

Without memory, there's no counterfactuals. Without counterfactuals, there's no causality.

## 5. Formalizing Causal Scaffolds

### Add `linked_trace_ids`

```json
"linked_trace_ids": ["trace-001", "trace-002"]
```
This supports:
- Forward references (goal → actions)
- Backward references (reflection → goal)

### Use Human-Readable Trace IDs

| Type        | Example Trace ID                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Goal        | goal-2024-05-15-start-journal        |
| Observation | obs-2024-05-17-journal-entry-1       |
| Reflection  | ref-2024-05-18-week-1-review         |

Avoid opaque UUID-only traces where clarity is needed.

### Add `causal_link` Relationship Types

```json
"linked_trace_ids": [
  { "trace_id": "goal-2024-05-15-start-journal", "relation": "follows_from" }
]
```

Supported relations:
- `follows_from`
- `fulfills`
- `derives_from`
- `contradicts`
- `reflects_on`

This enables future **graph analysis** and LLM-assisted trace chaining.

---

## 6. Goal Completion Protocols

Every `goal` trace should result in:
- A linked `observation`, or
- A linked `reflection` explaining divergence

### Completed Example

```json
{
  "type": "goal",
  "trace_id": "goal-2024-05-10-publish-blog",
  "completion_status": "completed",
  "linked_trace_ids": ["obs-2024-05-14-blog-published"]
}
```

### Abandoned Example

```json
{
  "type": "goal",
  "trace_id": "goal-2024-05-10-publish-blog",
  "completion_status": "abandoned",
  "linked_trace_ids": ["ref-2024-05-14-did-not-write"]
}
```

This structure ensures **causal closure** and trace accountability.

---

## 7. Metrics for Causal Evaluation

Chronologue can now compute:

- `% of goals with successful observations`
- `mean time-to-observation`
- `average deviation from planned duration`
- `frequency of goal revision, abandonment, or delay`

This supports personal feedback and system-wide benchmarking.

## 8. Best Practices

| Practice                         | Why It Matters                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Use `linked_trace_ids`           | Enables trace chaining and retrospection |
| Always close `goal` traces       | Builds narrative accountability         |
| Tag all `observation` + `reflection` traces | Enables clear causal divergence tracking |
| Use structured IDs               | Human-readable graphs and diffs         |
| Review trace chains weekly       | Detect drift, gaps, or blocked patterns |

Chronologue turns raw memory into structured introspection. Causal scaffolds allow agents—and humans—to understand what happened, why it happened, and how it might have gone differently.
