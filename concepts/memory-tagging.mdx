Memory tagging in Chronologue allows users and agents to organize, retrieve, and share meaningful subsets of memory traces. Tags act as **lightweight semantic labels**—designed to give users **control**, agents **precision**, and teams a **shared language for context**.

This document walks through the design motivations for tagging, the tension between structured control and intelligent retrieval, and the practical advantages of using tags for planning, reflection, and agent collaboration.

## 1. Why Tagging Matters

While language models can infer patterns from raw memory traces, Chronologue supports tagging for two core reasons:

### a. **Control Interface**

Tags let users shape the context used in agent tasks. For example:

- Summarize my goals from `#q2_review`
- Schedule around `#deep_work` blocks
- Reflect only on `#travel` memories this weekend

This is more than filtering—it’s a **way to think with memory**, not just about it.

### b. **Communication Interface**

Tags create a common vocabulary between users, agents, and collaborators. This enables:

- Sharing a memory cluster (`#team_sync`) with a new agent
- Broadcasting `#customer_feedback` traces to a product team
- Subscribing an agent to `#urgent_tasks` for autonomous triage

---

## 2. Schema Overview

Every memory trace in Chronologue can include an array of tags:

tags: ["deep_work", "2025Q2", "team_sync", "urgent"]

These tags are:

- Plain strings
- User- or agent-defined
- Stored alongside trace metadata

## 3. Use Cases

### a. Personal Context Scoping

User prompt:

"Can you generate a personal retrospective based on my #weekly_reflection and #fitness logs from April?"

System behavior:

- Fetches all memory traces with `tags` containing both `weekly_reflection` and `fitness`
- Limits by `timestamp` from `2025-04-01` to `2025-04-30`
- Passes to LLM as structured context block

### b. Multi-Agent Collaboration

- A user tags a batch of customer support transcripts with `#feature_request`
- Shares this tag cluster with a product roadmap agent and an investor report agent
- Each agent retrieves the same core memory, but interprets it for different planning tasks

### c. Cross-User Shared Memory

In a team workspace:

- A lead tags a set of traces with `#onboarding_guides`
- New team members can access this tag’s contents for reference
- An onboarding agent uses only `#onboarding_guides` to generate customized start plans

---

## 4. Prompt-Aware Tag Filters

Chronologue supports `#hashtags` in chat prompts:

Prompt:

"Summarize everything in #deep_work and #2025Q1 related to travel planning."

System:

- Parses `#deep_work` and `#2025Q1` as tag filters
- Retrieves intersected trace cluster
- Conditionally scopes memory for planning or reflection agents

This pattern allows users to **dynamically reframe memory context** with a single prompt.

---

## 5. Design Tension: Intelligence vs. Explicit Control

### Argument Against Tagging

- Modern LLMs can infer themes without tags
- Embeddings can cluster memories without manual labeling
- Tags require upkeep and structure

### Why Chronologue Still Embraces Tagging

- Tags allow **repeatable, editable, and inspectable** context control
- They enable **human-to-agent communication of memory intent**
- Tags support **parallel views** of the same memory (e.g., `#urgent`, `#revisit`, `#weekly`)

Tagging is not about redundancy—it’s about empowering users to **decide what matters and when**.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- Use simple, memorable tags: `#weekly`, `#team_sync`, `#urgent`
- Combine temporal and semantic tags: `#may`, `#q2_review`, `#travel`
- Let agents suggest tags during or after execution (e.g., “Would you like to tag this #deep_work?”)
- Regularly audit and summarize high-frequency tag clusters

---

## 7. Future Directions

- Tag versioning and namespaces for shared workspaces
- Auto-generated tags based on NLP themes and calendar context
- Agent-driven tag propagation and conditional triggers (e.g., if tagged `#urgent`, notify)
- Visual tag-based context composer for multi-agent systems
